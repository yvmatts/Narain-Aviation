       <p class="hidden-xs"><i class="fa fa-fighter-jet fc13"></i> “Compared to the steep growth of the Indian airline industry, there is no natural influx of homegrown pilots, especially commanders in India. We have to depend on expatriates,” Cornelis Vrieswijk, CEO of no-frills carrier GoAir, said in a recent interview. He added that the red tape and stringent regulatory procedures associated with getting an expatriate pilot ready to fly adds to the problem. </p>

       <p><i class="fa fa-fighter-jet fa14"></i> “It takes 40-50-60 days. The regulatory approvals are also more stringent than in other countries,” said Vrieswijk. </p>

       <p class="hidden-xs"><i class="fa fa-fighter-jet fc13"></i> “The DGCA (Directorate General of Civil Aviation) still uses several medical requisites laid down by the Indian Air Force for pilots, which makes it difficult for many expatriates,” said a senior pilot at a low-fare carrier. “Please remember, Indian companies can’t really afford American or European pilots. It’s usually Russians or Ukranians or Mexicans.” </p>

        <p> <i class="fa fa-fighter-jet "></i> Salary premiums for expatriates have also been lowered to control salary expenses, usually the second biggest cost component after fuel.</p>

       <p><i class="fa fa-fighter-jet fc1"></i> “An expatriate commander now gets about 30-35% higher base monthly salary ($13,000 or Rs 8.84 lakh) than his Indian counterpart, who gets about Rs 6.5 lakh, down from a 100% premium say three-five years before,” said the human resources chief of a top Indian carrier. “Also, most airlines have increased salary rates for Indian pilots by about 5-7% each year and not for expatriates, although some segments such as house rent allowance have been included.” </p>

       <p><i class="fa fa-fighter-jet fa1"></i> The growing pilot shortage is a global problem.</p>



        <p><i class="fa fa-fighter-jet fc13"></i> Pilots at European carriers such as RyanAir are seeking better working conditions by forming unions while those at Air France are planning industrial action over pay. At the recent annual meeting of the International Air Transport Association, its chief economist Brian Pearce cited wage pressures and pilot shortage as chronic symptoms of the global airline industry.</p>
        <p><i class="fa fa-fighter-jet fc1"></i> Pilots across the world are now flocking to the Middle East and China, said to be the best paymasters. Chinese carriers are giving up to $314,000 tax-free annually to foreign captains, more than double what an Indian carrier would pay, according to global reports. China requires 4,000-5,000 pilots every year for the next two decades, according to global estimates, about five times India’s requirement. Boeing estimates a requirement for close to 650,000 pilots for the global aviation industry in.</p>

       <p><i class="fa fa-fighter-jet fc1"></i> <strong>“By the end of four years with the company, a first officer gains the required expertise and experience to become the captain on an Airbus A320 or ATR aircraft,” said an IndiGo spokesperson. “As IndiGo will have a growing number of first officers, it will mean that on a continuous basis the company will be able to upgrade 300-400 senior first officers to captains on a yearly basis.”</strong></p>

       <p><i class="fa fa-fighter-jet fc13"></i> Spokespersons at Vistara and Air Asia India, the Tata group’s ventures with Singapore Airlines and Air Asia Bhd, respectively, also said the priority would be to train and upgrade in house pilots to make a pool of commanders.</p>
